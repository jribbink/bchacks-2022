##Inspiration

From the very beginning, the group wanted to take inspiration from the projects of the prior BCHacks events. Seeing the prevalence of games in the past few years, we decided that we wanted to make an interactive browser game. We wanted to make it stand out though, and so taking inspiration from League of Legends, and the Wild West, we came up with a, multiplayer online lasso-em-up.

##Challenges

Before entering the hackathon, our group had next to no experience in making games. While we did have some experience with Node.js, it was mostly limited to a simple storefront website, and many of the core skills of game development (sprite work, sound and image implementation) were mostly new to us.
